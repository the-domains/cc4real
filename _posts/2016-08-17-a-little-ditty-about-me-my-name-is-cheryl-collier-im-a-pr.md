A little ditty about me. My name is Cheryl Collier. I'm a professional hair and make-up artist, anti-aging consultant, designer, entrepreneur, blogger, dreamer, life changer, mother and instigator of real talk. 

I love to share my craft and the artistic ability of others. I feel it's important to appreciate beauty in all its forms. I try to help others love who they are, be comfortable in their own skin and embrace their natural beauty. I enjoy actively helping others to go after their dreams by giving them the support they need and the tools to achieve them. I speak my mind and expect others to do the same. I'm not a sugar coater so expect to get the raw truth from me. I'm an advocate for the positive things in life and have no problem kicking the negative to the curb.

I know that many people won't like what I have to say or what I have to share, but I also believe that there are some who will find my candor refreshing and appreciate it. I hope that by visiting my site, you can get a little inspiration for your next artistic expression or be motivated to make positive changes in your life and of those you love or relate to a story and know you are not alone or simply just put a smile on your face when you need it.

If you ever have questions about what I do, feel free to send me an email at ccpromua@gmail.com with your topic in the subject line. So thanks for visiting today and keep checking in.
